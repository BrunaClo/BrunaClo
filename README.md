### Hi there ðŸ˜Š


I'm a recently converted data analyst that comes from a social sciences background, political sciences to be more specific. I fell in love with data analysis while doing my master's thesis. I studied the social profile of federal deputies elected in Brazil in 2018 to better understand political representation, the institutional arrangements and the state of democracy.


At a certain point, I found myself torn between pursuing a doctoral degree and starting the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp. I was drawn to the idea of better understanding data analytics. I believe that this field can offer me a bigger possibility for broad social impact than academia does. So I dived right into it.
